<b><u>Unit Tests</u></b><br>

<p>
If you are keeping up on the reading, and I hope you are, then you've read
about the <a href="first.html">F.I.R.S.T.</a> principles of unit testing.
<hr>
We will be using an inclusion-only C++ unit testing framework called Catch to
perform the unit testing for our project.

<b><u>Assignment :: Scripting and Command Line Utility Chaining :: Due Wednesday: Jan 17 <i>Before</i> class</u></b><br>
Our next assignment in scripting and linux utility usage involves parsing the
unofficial transcript generated by WebAdvisor.  The information in your
transcript page would be useful for a number of things including (but not 
limited to) filling out your course work checklist, doing a degree audit,
or planning out the next classes to take and when to register for them (*ahem*).
<p>
Obviously, we don't want to have you all putting your own transcripts in the
repository due to FERPA and other legal issues so I've created a couple of dummy
pages for us to work with.  The goal of the exercise is to write <i>minimal</i>
code to turn the webpage full of html tags into something that could be
read into a tool and used for course planning, degree audits, etc.
<p>
Unlike the first exercise (wa0) it will be hard to go to stackoverflow or a
similar site and find readymade code to do the job.  Use what we've learned
about <i>sed</i>, <i>grep</i>, <i>cut</i>, <i>awk</i>, and other commands to
manipulate the files into a usable form.
<p>
<pre>
% cat paulaPerfect.html | grep ... | cut ... | sed | sed | sed

</pre>
What's coming out of the script or linux utility chain is just the information
about the courses Paula Perfect took.  Each field is colon separated to make
parsing it later easy (e.g. cut -f1 -d:).  Note that the two files are different
in a couple ways.  First, Paula didn't retake any courses and Peter has retaken
a number of courses.  Paula started in the summer and Peter started in the fall.
It would not hurt to look at your own transcripts and see if there are other
differences not captured by these two examples.  Maybe you transfered credits
in or you've taken courses at some other university, etc.  Test, Test, Test.
<p>
You are welcome to talk to one another about various ways of doing this but
I <strong>Strongly</strong> suggest you learn to do this kind of work without
someone showing you how first.  It <b>will</b> come in handy for the rest of
your career in the field.  I <b>will</b> be testing you on this sort of thing.
Working these sorts of problems is an excellent way to learn to think 
incrementally which is the essence of taking something you know how to do and 
teaching a computer how to do it.
<p>
There are two example files <i>paulaPerfect.html</i> and 
<i>peterProcrastinator.html</i> in the repo.  Use them for initial testing but
do not think that if your solution works on them it will work on everything.
Test, Test, Test.  These two files are randomly generated, if they bare a
similarity in some other student's transcript it is completely coincidental.
