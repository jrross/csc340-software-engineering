<h1><center>Catch and beginning with git</center></h1>
<hr>
<b><u>Goals of this assignment</u></b><br>
<ul>
<li> Start to become more familiar with command line git</li>
<li> Start to learn how to use the Catch C++ unit testing framework.</li>
</ul>

<a href="GettingStartedWithCatch.html">Here</a> is a simple walk thru using
the Catch C++ framework to do TDD (test driven development) on a simple /
silly C++ class called IntegerInfo.
<p>
Since we'll all be working on files with a similar name, we won't be able to
work in the same repository space as for the previous two homework assignments.
When you start working on this assignment (after doing the 'git pull' to get
the files).  You will:
<ul>
<li> Create a branch
<pre>
% git branch YourName
% git checkout YourName
OR
% git checkout -b YourName
</pre>
</li>
<li> Edit, add, commit your files and changes</li>
<li> Push your branch to the remote repository
<pre>
% git push -u origin YourName
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
