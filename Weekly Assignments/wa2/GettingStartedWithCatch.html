Catch is an include file only unit test framework developed by Phil Nash.  It's
an easy way to start unit testing C++ code without the overhead of a complicated
testing framework.
<p>
The Catch header file can be downloaded from the github repository via cloning
or using wget to grab the latest catch.hpp file.
<pre>
wget https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/releases/download/v1.10.0/catch.hpp
</pre>
<p>
The repository includes a <a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md">tutorial</a> with a simple example as well as a 
<a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/Readme.md">reference</a> that describes:
<ul>
<li> Writing tests</li>
<li> Fine Tuning</li>
<li> Running</li>
<li> A FAQ</li>
<li> General contribution, projects using Catch and release notes</li>
</ul>
The tutorial walks through a very simple example of writing some tests for
a simple C++ class and the steps we would take to start learning about
Test Driven Development (TDD).
<p>
The simple rules for TDD are (also found on Wikipedia):
<ol>
<li> Add a test</li>
<li> Run all tests and see the new test fail</li>
<li> Write only enough code to make the test pass</li>
<li> Run the tests and see them all pass</li>
<li> Refactor code</li>
<li> Repeat as necessary</li>
</ol>

<b>A simple example</b><br>
<hr>
The requirement is to create a C++ class named IntegerInfo.  We'll work through
a simple example of using TDD and creating unit tests during our development
of this class.  Some of the features of the class we're going to develop include
<ul>
<li> Detect if a number is composite</li>
<li> Detect if a number is prime</li>
<li> Produce a list of prime factors of a number</li>
<li> Detect if a number is even or odd</li>
<li> Report the number of ones in the binary representation of the number</li>
</ul>
<p>
Start with a test which simply tries to instantiate an object of our IntegerInfo
class.
<p>
<pre>
main.cpp:
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN

#include "catch.hpp"

TEST_CASE("Create an IntegerInfo object")
{
   IntegerInfo info;
}
</pre>
A failure to compile is a failure.  Obviously this will not compile because
we've yet to even create the class in question.  Trying to compile this:
<pre>
% g++ -o main main.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall -Werror
main.cpp: In function 'void ____C_A_T_C_H____T_E_S_T____0()':
main.cpp:7:4: error: 'IntegerInfo' was not declared in this scope
    IntegerInfo info;
    ^
main.cpp:7:16: error: expected ';' before 'info'
    IntegerInfo info;
                ^
</pre>
Depending on your version of the g++ compiler, it will produce something like
the above compilation error.  As expected, the compilation was a failure since
'IntegerInfo' was not declared in this scope.
<p>
The rules say, write just enough code to make this failure go away.  We will
add the following:
<pre>
class IntegerInfo
{
};
</pre>
Compiling this file now succeeds.  We can run this test and see that one test
is run and passes and there were no assertions.  At this point we could go
through a refactoring step but it's a little early to start that so we'll just
go back to step one and write another test.
<p>
The test we wrote tests to see if a default IntegerInfo object can be created,
let's see if we can instantiate an IntegerInfo object with a parameter:
<pre>
TEST_CASE("Create an IntegerInfo object from a literal integer")
{
   IntegerInfo info(100);
}
</pre>
As expected, compiling this test will fail in compilation because there is not
currently a constructor that takes an integer parameter.
<p>
Modify the class definition as follows:
<pre>
class IntegerInfo
{
   int theNumber;
public:
   IntegerInfo(int num) : theNumber(num) {}
};
</pre>
Rerun the tests but the compilation still fails.  This is because once we
create a non-default constructor, the compiler stops providing the default
constructors.  We need to further modify our class definition as follows:
<pre>
class IntegerInfo
{
   int theNumber;
public:
   IntegerInfo() {}
   IntegerInfo(int num) : theNumber(num) {}
};
</pre>
Now we see that two test cases are run and pass but still no assertions.
Again, looking at refactoring it's still reasonable to defer that for the
moment.  We want to more fairly quickly during the early stages of development
and unnecessary refactorings will not benefit the early stages.  Of course,
we could have changed the constructor to accept an optional parameter as
well.
<p>
Let's pick one of the member functions described in the capabilities we want
for the class.  Deciding whether or not the object represents an odd number.
<p>
<b>Write the test</b><br>
<pre>
TEST_CASE("Test for odd and even numbers")
{
   IntegerInfo info(1);
   REQUIRE(info.isOdd() == true);
}
</pre>
The compilation will fail because the member function does not exist.  We add
the member function and try again:
<pre>
class IntegerInfo
{
   int theNumber;
public:
   IntegerInfo() {}
   IntegerInfo(int num) : theNumber(num) {}

   bool isOdd() { return false; }
};
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> We just pick either true or false for the function to return for
now.  Again, we just want enough code for the last failure to pass.  It may
mean we get another failure but we're incrementally moving forward.
<p>
Sure enough, the tests now compile but the assertion fails.  We picked the
isOdd function to just always return false and our assertion <i>REQUIRE(info.isOdd() == true)</i> requires isOdd for the number '1' to return true.
<p>
At this point we want to write enough code for our current failure to pass.
<pre>
   bool isOdd() { return (theNumber % 2 == 1); }
</pre>
Now we see three tests run, all passing and one assertion.  We can now add
some more tests in this test case.
<pre>
   IntegerInfo number0(0);
   REQUIRE(number0.isOdd() == false);
   IntegerInfo number2(2);
   REQUIRE(number0.isOdd() == false);
</pre>
This process is repeated for the requirements of the IntegerInfo class.  After
adding another method (perhaps isEven() or isPrime()) we would probably take
the opportunity to perform a first round of refactoring.  Breaking out the
interface from the implementation into separate files.  We would also want
to write a compilation script or Makefile which will build and then run the
tests with a single command.
<p>
<b>Git behavior</b><br>
As we are working through these tests and methods, we will want to be making
commits to the repository every time we get something working.  For example,
after the initial test (the one where all we do is try to construct an object)
we would want to commit the file with a comment indicating an initial state.
As more tests are added and code is written to get them working, additional
commits are made.  Try to avoid committing code that does not compile or has
failures when running.  There are several reasons for this rule of thumb.
First, it's aways easier to return to working code/tests.  If the first thing
you see is a compiler error or test failures it's hard to get excited to
work on the application.  Second, when you work in a team most organizations
have strict rules against committing known, non-working code.  It's a huge
no-no to commit non-compiling code.  Finally, you want to leave your repository
in a state in which you can share, release, or publish it at a moment's notice.
While it's true you will not always have code that is meant to be shared, there
are times when it's important and you want to develop good habits.
